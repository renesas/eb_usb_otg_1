# eb_usb_otg_1
Expansion Board for USB-OTG

This Expansion Board (EB) connects to the pin headers on either TB-S5D5 or EK-RA6M2.  Due to pin header differences, this EB will only work with the listed MCU boards.
The circuitry enables the USB On The Go (USB-OTG) functions of the respective MCU devices.

The following rework must be performed on the MCU board (TB-S5D5 or EK-RA6M2) to enable USB-OTG:
    1) Cut trace-cut jumpers E15, E16, E17 and E30
    2) Close solder bridges E12, E20 and E21
